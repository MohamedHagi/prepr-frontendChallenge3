# React Application - PreprLabs Challenge 3

## Overview

Welcome to the PreprLabs Dashboard/Create Project Page Clone! This project focuses on creating a web dashboard that serves as a reporting interface to monitor website performance. The dashboard allows users to track various metrics such as visitors, page views, and online conversions, providing valuable insights across different contexts such as digital marketing, social media, SEO, UX, and eCommerce. As well as the create project page.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to recreate the [PreprLabs](https://preprlabs.org/) user home and create project pages using React. The application should enable users to create a project and display it on the dashboard. Emphasizing a responsive design, the project aims to implement key click events and mouseover effects for an interactive user experience.

- **Create Project**: Users can create a project with a focus on 10 fields, including a cover image, on the [createProject](https://preprlabs.org/createProject/0) page.

- **Dashboard Interaction**: The dashboard page includes interactive elements such as mouseover effects. Users can click on buttons to create a project, set a cover image, and access project details.
